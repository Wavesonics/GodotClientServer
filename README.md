# GodotClientServer
An example of how to setup a Client/Server architecture in Godot within a single project.

Once I've got the design to a place that's solid, I'd like to release this as a Project Template on the asset library, so it can be used as a starting point for any multiplayer project that doesn't want to be peer to peer.

I'd love any feedback or suggestions for how to improve things.


## Why?
There is already a good tutorial out there showing how to set up a dedicated server in Godot using two separate projects. This has a number of advantages. However, it has in my view one huge disadvantage: Maintainability.

In a two project setup, you have to somehow keep shared logic in sync between the two projects. You can imagine a number of ways to do this, but I would massively prefer to just fix a bug once, and not have any steps to remember. Because I'll forget.

So this idea here is to have one Godot project, and keep as much of the code shared between client and server as possible.


## High level design
This relies on an aspect of Godot's export system called "Features." Each export template specifies which Features it supports, such as Windows, 64 bit, PC vs Mobile, etc.

These are the built-in features, but Godot also allows you to specify your own custom features. So you could, for instance, have two different Windows Export Presets, and they could each contain different custom Features that you specify.

Importantly, the presence of these features can be queried at runtime:

``` OS.has_feature("X") ```

You probably see where this is going now.

We can have two different features: "client" and "server"

Our `Main Scene` will be a simple `Entry` scene that detects which feature is present, and then launches into a different Scene accordingly.

The Client will launch into a main menu, and the Server will launch into a Lobby scene, where it will open a port and begin listening for clients.


# Project Structure
```
root/
|
- common
- client
- server
```

**common** contains the bulk of the game code. This is all of the code that runs on both client and server. This is where the real benefit of this architecture comes from.


## Client/Server specific code
Each scene in `common` will have a corresponding inherited scene in both client and server. This allows you to do client or server specific stuff quite easily.

The scenes are named to prevent confusion in an editor so:
```
common/Lobby.tscn
client/ClientLobby.tscn
server/ServerLobby.tscn
```

So the only trick here is that scene transitions must be in the inherited scenes, since the server will change to `ServerGame.tscn` and clients will change to `ClientGame.tscn`. This can be accomplished easily with overriden methods or signals.

## Running on a headless machine
If this was for some real game, the server likely would be on a headless machine. To accommodate this, we can use Godot's server export template. It is a graphicless version of Godot, and will not attempt to open a window or use any graphics API.

This means you can easily run the dedicated server on a headless Linux box.

## Down sides
- This will still load all of the graphical assets, so it will not be as slim in memory as it could possibly be in the two project approach.

## Misc
- This is shown working with a Lobby based game, but it could just as easily work with a join-in-progress type of game.
- I'm not completely happy with how I split up the Network classes (BaseNetwork, ClientNetwork, ServerNetwork). So I may actualy get rid of that.
- This is *NOT* Server authoratative. It could be in theory, but that would take more work.
